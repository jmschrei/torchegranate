    "Out-of-core learning refers to the process of training a model on an amount of data that cannot fit in memory. There are several approaches that can be described as out-of-core, but here we refer to the ability to derive exact updates to a model from a massive data set, despite not being able to fit the entire thing in memory.\n",
    "\n",
    "This out-of-core learning approach is implemented for all of torchegranate's models using two methods. The first is a summarize method that will take in a batch of data and reduce it down to additive sufficient statistics. Because these summaries are additive, after the first call, these summaries are added to the previously stored summaries. Once the entire data set has been seen, the stored sufficient statistics will be identical to those that would have been derived if the entire data set had been seen at once. The second method is the from_summaries method, which uses the stored sufficient statistics to derive parameter updates for the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "A common solution to having too much data is to randomly select an amount of data that does fit in memory to use in the place of the full data set. While simple to implement, this approach is likely to yield lower performance models because it is exposed to less data. However, by using out-of-core learning, on can train their models on a massive amount of data without being limited by the amount of memory their computer has."
