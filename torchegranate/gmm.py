class GeneralMixtureModel(BayesMixin, Distribution):
	"""A general mixture model.

	Frequently, data is generated from multiple components. A mixture model
	is a probabilistic model that explicitly models data as having come from
	a set of probability distributions rather than a single one. Usually, the
	abbreviation "GMM" refers to a Gaussian mixture model, but any probability
	distribution or heterogeneous set of distributions can be included in the
	mixture, making it a "general" mixture model.

	However, a mixture model itself has all the same theoretical properties as a
	probability distribution because it is one. Hence, it can be used in any
	situation that a simpler distribution could, such as an emission
	distribution for a HMM or a component of a Bayes classifier.

	Conversely, many models that are usually thought of as composed of
	probability distributions but distinct from them, e.g. hidden Markov models,
	Markov chains, and Bayesian networks, can in theory be passed into this
	object and incorporated into the mixture.

	If the distributions included in the mixture are not initialized, the
	fitting step will first initialize them by running k-means for a small
	number of iterations and fitting the distributions to the clusters that
	are discovered.


	Parameters
	----------
	distributions: tuple or list
		A set of distribution objects. These objects do not need to be
		initialized, i.e., can be "Normal()". 

	priors: tuple, numpy.ndarray, torch.Tensor, or None. shape=(k,), optional
		The prior probabilities over the given distributions. Default is None.

	max_iter: int, optional
		The number of iterations to do in the EM step of fitting the
		distribution. Default is 10.

	tol: float, optional
		The threshold at which to stop during fitting when the improvement
		goes under. Default is 0.1.

	inertia: float, [0, 1], optional
		Indicates the proportion of the update to apply to the parameters
		during training. When the inertia is 0.0, the update is applied in
		its entirety and the previous parameters are ignored. When the
		inertia is 1.0, the update is entirely ignored and the previous
		parameters are kept, equivalently to if the parameters were frozen.

	frozen: bool, optional
		Whether all the parameters associated with this distribution are frozen.
		If you want to freeze individual pameters, or individual values in those
		parameters, you must modify the `frozen` attribute of the tensor or
		parameter directly. Default is False.

	check_data: bool, optional
		Whether to check properties of the data and potentially recast it to
		torch.tensors. This does not prevent checking of parameters but can
		slightly speed up computation when you know that your inputs are valid.
		Setting this to False is also necessary for compiling. Default is True.

	verbose: bool, optional
		Whether to print the improvement and timings during training.
