class HiddenMarkovModel(GraphMixin, Distribution):
	"""A hidden Markov model.

	A hidden Markov model is an extension of a mixture model to sequences by
	including a transition matrix between the elements of the mixture. Each of
	the algorithms for a hidden Markov model are essentially just a revision
	of those algorithms to incorporate this transition matrix.

	There are two main ways one can implement a hidden Markov model: either the
	transition matrix can be implemented in a dense, or a sparse, manner. If the
	transition matrix is dense, implementing it in a dense manner allows for
	the primary computation to use matrix multiplications which can be very
	fast. However, if the matrix is sparse, these matrix multiplications will
	be fairly slow and end up significantly slower than the sparse version of
	a matrix multiplication.

	This object is a wrapper for both implementations, which can be specified
	using the `kind` parameter. Choosing the right implementation will not
	effect the accuracy of the results but will change the speed at which they
	are calculated. 	

	Separately, there are two ways to instantiate the hidden Markov model. The
	first is by passing in a set of distributions, a dense transition matrix, 
	and optionally start/end probabilities. The second is to initialize the
	object without these and then to add edges using the `add_edge` method
	and to add nodes using the `add_nodes` method. Importantly, the way that
	you choose to initialize the hidden Markov model is independent of the
	implementation that you end up choosing. If you pass in a dense transition
	matrix, this will be converted to a sparse matrix with all the zeros
	dropped if you choose `kind='sparse'`.


	Parameters
	----------
	distributions: tuple or list
		A set of distribution objects. These objects do not need to be
		initialized, i.e., can be "Normal()". 

	edges: numpy.ndarray, torch.Tensor, or None. shape=(k,k), optional
		A dense transition matrix of probabilities for how each node or
		distribution passed in connects to each other one. This can contain
		many zeroes, and when paired with `kind='sparse'`, will drop those
		elements from the matrix. Default is None.

	starts: list, numpy.ndarray, torch.Tensor, or None. shape=(k,), optional
		The probability of starting at each node. If not provided, assumes
		these probabilities are uniform. Default is None.

	ends: list, numpy.ndarray, torch.Tensor, or None. shape=(k,), optional
		The probability of ending at each node. If not provided, assumes
		these probabilities are uniform. Default is None.

	kind: str, 'sparse' or 'dense', optional
		The underlying implementation of the transition matrix to use.
		Default is 'sparse'. 

	init: str, optional
		The initialization to use for the k-means initialization approach.
		Default is 'first-k'. Must be one of:

			'first-k': Use the first k examples from the data set
			'random': Use a random set of k examples from the data set
			'submodular-facility-location': Use a facility location submodular
				objective to initialize the k-means algorithm
			'submodular-feature-based': Use a feature-based submodular objective
				to initialize the k-means algorithm.

	max_iter: int, optional
		The number of iterations to do in the EM step, which for HMMs is
		sometimes called Baum-Welch. Default is 10.

	tol: float, optional
		The threshold at which to stop during fitting when the improvement
		goes under. Default is 0.1.

	inertia: float, [0, 1], optional
		Indicates the proportion of the update to apply to the parameters
		during training. When the inertia is 0.0, the update is applied in
		its entirety and the previous parameters are ignored. When the
		inertia is 1.0, the update is entirely ignored and the previous
		parameters are kept, equivalently to if the parameters were frozen.

	frozen: bool, optional
		Whether all the parameters associated with this distribution are frozen.
		If you want to freeze individual pameters, or individual values in those
		parameters, you must modify the `frozen` attribute of the tensor or
		parameter directly. Default is False.

	random_state: int or None, optional
		The random state to make randomness deterministic. If None, not
		deterministic. Default is None.

	verbose: bool, optional
		Whether to print the improvement and timings during training.
